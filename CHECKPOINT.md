# Embeddings Transformer Checkpoint

## Latest Updates (2025-02-21)

### Query Response Improvements
- Enhanced relevance checking for search results
  - Added similarity score threshold (0.7)
  - Implemented key term matching from questions
  - Check content relevance using term match ratio
- Improved state-specific handling
  - Added state context to LLM prompts
  - Prevent mixing of information from different states
  - State-specific guidance in "no data" responses
- Better source handling
  - Only include sources for highly relevant results
  - Empty sources array when information not found
  - Higher threshold (0.7) for source inclusion

### System Prompt Updates
- Added clearer rules about state-specific information
- Enhanced guidance for handling missing information
- Added explicit rules about source relevance

### Caching Improvements
- Different cache durations for data vs no-data responses
- State-specific cache keys
- Improved cache key generation with state context

## Best Practices Implementation

### Content Quality
- Validate search results before processing
- Handle edge cases (no data, irrelevant matches)
- Clean and normalize responses appropriately

### Performance
- Efficient caching with Redis
- Async processing for search operations
- Optimized relevance checking

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for missing data
- Proper state validation
- Graceful handling of cache failures

## Next Steps
1. Monitor and tune relevance thresholds
2. Enhance key term matching algorithm
3. Implement additional state-specific validations
4. Consider adding confidence scores to responses
